# Secure and Well-Tested Django API with JWT Authentication and Unit Testing

## Introduction

This README provides documentation for a secure and well-tested Django API that utilizes JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication and includes a comprehensive suite of unit tests. This API has been designed with security and reliability in mind, ensuring that user data is protected and that the codebase is thoroughly tested to catch and prevent bugs.

## Features

- **JWT Authentication**: Users must authenticate using JSON Web Tokens, which provides secure and stateless authentication.
- **Unit Testing**: A robust suite of unit tests ensures the reliability and stability of the API.
- **Security**: Security best practices have been implemented to protect against common web vulnerabilities.
- **Documentation**: Detailed documentation is available to assist developers in understanding and using the API.
- **Modular Structure**: The API codebase is organized into well-structured modules to enhance maintainability.

## Requirements

Before getting started, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.x
- Django
- Django REST framework
- JWT library
- SQLite or another database of your choice
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/secure-api.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd secure-api
   ```

3. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Set up the database and apply migrations:

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. Create a superuser to access the Django admin interface:

   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

7. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

The API should now be running locally at http://localhost:8000/.

## Configuration

- **JWT Secret Key**: Update the `SECRET_KEY` in the `settings.py` file with your own secret key for JWT token generation.
- **Database Configuration**: Modify the database settings in `settings.py` as needed (e.g., switching to PostgreSQL).
- **Allowed Hosts**: Update the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` setting in `settings.py` to restrict access to your API.

## Usage

- Access the Django admin interface at http://localhost:8000/admin/ to manage users and other data.
- Use tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [curl](https://curl.se/) to interact with the API endpoints.
- Refer to the API documentation (available at http://localhost:8000/docs/) for detailed information on available endpoints, request formats, and responses.

## Testing

To run the unit tests, use the following command:

```bash
python manage.py test
```

The test suite will execute, providing feedback on the code's reliability and correctness.

## Security Considerations

- Always keep your `SECRET_KEY` and other sensitive information secure.
- Implement rate limiting and other security measures as needed to protect against abuse.
- Regularly update dependencies and apply security patches.
- Follow Django and Django REST framework security best practices.
